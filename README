PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT::Map:

A PDL interface to the GMT (Generic Mapping Tools).  This allows one to access
a detailed coastline, river, lake and national boundary database covering the
entire world.  

This package includes a function, 'fetch', which will give raw lon/lat PDLs from
the GMT database.  It also includes the PDL::Graphics::PGPLOT compatible routines:

worldmap   -- Draw a world map using PGPLOT
map_points -- Add points to an existing world map (similar to the PDL::PGPLOT 'points' command, 
              but including map projection)
map_line   -- Add lines to an existing world map (similar to the PDL::PGPLOT 'points' command, 
              but including map projection)

The following are required for installation:

-- PDL v2.1 or later with bad value support compiled in (Set WITH_BADVAL => 1 in perldl.conf)
-- the pgplot plotting library (http://www.astro.caltech.edu/~tjp/pgplot)
-- the PGPLOT perl interface to pgplot (http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local/modules/by-module/PGPLOT)
-- the netCDF library (see http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/packages/netcdf/index.html)

INSTALLATION:

Installation should be the normal:

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test

(as root)
make install

Best of luck!
